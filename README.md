Starting late Friday on 22 may so apologies now for rushed nature which will be obvious
Combined with complete lack of coding experience it is going to be a bumpy ride but that only makes the highs all the more exhilerating!
Keep your seat belt FASTENED

Monday arvo on 25 May and I have done most of this in one day
Need to sort out the boxes on index.html and fluff out references but o/wise good to go
Really can't believe it....!

Okay getting tired now and dear Osmond Ong has shared sticky footer so not stuck on that one.
I have agonised over putting in some @media queries but have got too emotionally attached to wrecking it
This is why you should start your homework earlier .... right ?!!!
